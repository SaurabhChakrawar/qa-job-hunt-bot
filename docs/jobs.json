We deal with complex data, dynamic pricing algorithms, and high-traffic dashboards. In this role, you won’t just write scripts; you will own the automation architecture. You will work side-by-side with Developers and Product Managers to ensure that our React-based platform is robust, reliable, and ready for deployment. You will build scalable automation frameworks that catch regressions before they reach our users. This role is fully remote and open to individuals who reside in India . Key Responsibilities: Architect the Framework: Design, build, and maintain a scalable E2E automation framework using Cypress.io and Java Script . Focus on reusability, stability (handling flakes), and speed. API & Backend Validation: Go beyond the UI. Implement API automation (using cy.request or tools like Postman/Rest-Assured) and write complex SQL queries to validate our pricing logic and data accuracy. CI/CD Integration: Own the “Quality Pipeline.” Collaborate with DevOps to integrate automated tests into Jenkins , ensuring rapid feedback loops for every commit. Shift-Left Quality: Participate in design and requirement reviews (grooming) to identify test scenarios early. Advocate for testability in the codebase. Defect Management: Identify, document, and track defects in Jira/ClickUp . Provide developers with detailed root-cause analysis (logs, screenshots, network traces) rather than just “bug reports.” Continuous Improvement: Stay updated on Cypress features (e.g., Component Testing, Cypress Studio) and industry trends to continuously optimize our testing strategy. What We Are Looking For (The Must-Haves): Automation Expertise: 3+ years of hands-on automation experience in Cypress.io . Strong Coding Skills: Proficient in TypeScript or JavaScript (ES6+) . You understand asynchronous code, promises, and the DOM. The “SDET” Mindset: You treat test code like production code—clean, modular, and version-controlled (Git/Bitbucket). Database Proficiency: Comfortable writing SQL joins and queries to verify data persistence and business logic. API Testing: Solid understanding of RESTful services and experience automating API tests. Tooling: Experience with CI/CD tools (Jenkins), Test Management (BrowserStack/ClickUp), and Cross-browser testing (BrowserStack). Nice to Have (The Differentiators): Experience testing in Native React.js Mobile applications is a huge plus. Experience with Visual Regression Testing tools (e.g., Percy, Applitools).
