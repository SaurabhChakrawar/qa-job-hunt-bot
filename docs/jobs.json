      "description": "Your tasks The Mission We’re looking for someone who loves the intersection of food science, law, and logistics. At KoRo, we don't have an onsite laboratory; instead, we rely on a high-performing network of external partners. We also do not have our own production and rely on a large supplier base that produces top-quality products. Your job is to be the brain behind that coordination - making sure our products are safe, our testing is smart, and our decisions are backed by data. Location: This role is based at our warehouse in Alzenau, just outside Frankfurt. What You’ll Be Doing 1. Managing the External Analysis (Your Main Focus) (80%) Sample Coordination: You’ll be hands-on with our products, preparing and coordinating samples to be sent out to our external labs. Smart Testing: You’ll consistently perform risk assessments to decide what we test and how often. This includes keeping up with our planned schedule and jumping into action for ad-hoc or reactive testing when the need arises. You will continuously assess the risk of our testing strategy and ensure it aligns with our philosophy of high quality and food safety. Insight over Data: You won’t just read lab reports; you’ll translate those results into actual insights. You’ll be the one making the risk-based call on whether a product is released or blocked. Food Law Authority: You’ll ensure everything stays compliant with German and European food law. You’ll become our local expert on DGHM values, contaminants, and pesticides. Partner Management: You’ll be the main point of contact for our external labs, keeping an eye on the budget and making sure we’re getting the best service for our spend. 2. Warehouse Support (Your Secondary Focus) You’ll work closely with your local QA counterpart in Alzenau, who takes the lead on day-to-day physical warehouse checks. (20%) Supportive Eyes: You’ll assist with spot-check incoming goods and sensory tastings. Problem Solving: When quality deviations pop up on the floor, you’ll help investigate the root cause. Keeping it Clean: You’ll help manage quality documentation, supplier 4D reports, and our library of retain samples. Your profile Who You Are Language: You speak and write excellent German and English (C1 level). You’re comfortable navigating a complex German legal text one minute and talking to an international supplier the next. Education: You have a degree in Food Science, Food Chemistry, Oecotrophology, or a related field. Legal Mind: You understand the \"logic\" behind food regulations and can explain why a pesticide level matters. Software & Data Skills: You are highly proficient in Microsoft Office or Google Workspace. You can work excellently with data in Excel and are comfortable using modern project management tools like Notion, Asana, or Monday.com to keep your work organized. Reliable & Independent: You’re happy working at our Alzenau hub, keeping things running smoothly while staying in sync with the team in Berlin. What you can expect from",

We deal with complex data, dynamic pricing algorithms, and high-traffic dashboards. In this role, you won’t just write scripts; you will own the automation architecture. You will work side-by-side with Developers and Product Managers to ensure that our React-based platform is robust, reliable, and ready for deployment. You will build scalable automation frameworks that catch regressions before they reach our users. This role is fully remote and open to individuals who reside in India . Key Responsibilities: Architect the Framework: Design, build, and maintain a scalable E2E automation framework using Cypress.io and Java Script . Focus on reusability, stability (handling flakes), and speed. API & Backend Validation: Go beyond the UI. Implement API automation (using cy.request or tools like Postman/Rest-Assured) and write complex SQL queries to validate our pricing logic and data accuracy. CI/CD Integration: Own the “Quality Pipeline.” Collaborate with DevOps to integrate automated tests into Jenkins , ensuring rapid feedback loops for every commit. Shift-Left Quality: Participate in design and requirement reviews (grooming) to identify test scenarios early. Advocate for testability in the codebase. Defect Management: Identify, document, and track defects in Jira/ClickUp . Provide developers with detailed root-cause analysis (logs, screenshots, network traces) rather than just “bug reports.” Continuous Improvement: Stay updated on Cypress features (e.g., Component Testing, Cypress Studio) and industry trends to continuously optimize our testing strategy. What We Are Looking For (The Must-Haves): Automation Expertise: 3+ years of hands-on automation experience in Cypress.io . Strong Coding Skills: Proficient in TypeScript or JavaScript (ES6+) . You understand asynchronous code, promises, and the DOM. The “SDET” Mindset: You treat test code like production code—clean, modular, and version-controlled (Git/Bitbucket). Database Proficiency: Comfortable writing SQL joins and queries to verify data persistence and business logic. API Testing: Solid understanding of RESTful services and experience automating API tests. Tooling: Experience with CI/CD tools (Jenkins), Test Management (BrowserStack/ClickUp), and Cross-browser testing (BrowserStack). Nice to Have (The Differentiators): Experience testing in Native React.js Mobile applications is a huge plus. Experience with Visual Regression Testing tools (e.g., Percy, Applitools). Background in FinTech, SaaS, or data-heavy industries. How to apply for this role? Please fill out the form with the required details.
